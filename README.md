# Maestro

Maestro is an open-source web interface to run and manage Ansible playbooks and inventories.

## Project Vision

The first goal of Maestro is to make it **easy to use Ansible locally**, without requiring Git repositories or external integrations.
Everything will be stored and managed inside Maestro itself — playbooks, inventories, variables, and run history.

This makes it simple for teams or individuals who just want to:

- Run Ansible playbooks from a web UI.
- Keep a local inventory of servers.
- Store variables and secrets in one place.
- See the logs of every execution.

## Early Stage Goals

1. **Local Playbooks**
   Upload or create playbooks directly in the UI.
2. **Local Inventories**
   Manage your servers and groups without external tools.
3. **Variables & Secrets**
   Store environment variables and secrets safely.
4. **Runs & Logs**
   Execute playbooks and view logs in real time.
5. **Schedules (optional)**
   Run playbooks on a defined schedule.

## Roadmap

- Git integration for playbooks and inventories.
- Role-based access control.
- Notifications and webhooks.

## Status

Maestro is in early development.
Expect fast iterations and breaking changes at the beginning.
